# Welcome!

### Mission Statement

We are a diverse team of interdisciplinary scientists based at Mount Holyoke College in Western Massachuestts (and sometimes other institutions). We work collaboratively to research a broad range of ecophysiological questions in marine invertebrates including:&#x20;

* Tropical coral reefs
* Temperate corals
* Eelgrass and shellfish interactions

As a lab at a primarily undergraudate institution (PUI) and gender diverse historically womens college, we place extra emphasis on student opporunities, training, and mentoring and strive daily to build an equitable, safe, and fun learning and working environment.&#x20;
