# Student Expectations

**As students in the lab, you agree to:**&#x20;

1.) **All of the above in the** [code of conduct](code-of-conduct-and-community-guidelines.md).

2.) **Register for course credit** (295 or 395) **or get paid for your work** (Lynk, Research Assistance Grants, etc). I belive you should be compensated for your time be it through course credit or monetary compensation. If you are interested in volunteering we can discuss this on a case by case basis, but I generally discourage exploitative practices such as this. There are exceptions to this rule so please come talk to me if you are interested.&#x20;

3.) **Agree to a work schedule for the semester**. During your early semester meeting with Justin you will agree to a work schedule for the term that matches your salary or credit hour load as well as your personal / academic schedule. This schedule can be flexible and is subject to change as your needs and course load changes across the term but in general, we will set a schedule and try to stick to it. This will be part of your individual development plan (IDP).&#x20;

4.) **Develop research / lab goals for each semester**. During your early semester meeting with Justin you will develop research goals for the term. Justin will help you with this! These are targets for you to aim for during the term so you have a way to document your progress. This will be part of your individual development plan (IDP).&#x20;

5.) **Attend meetings when possible.** We will all agree on lab meeting times and frequency. They will likely occur every two weeks but may occur monthly at times. Lab meetings will involve sharing of data and progress, troubleshooting, Q\&A, career development, skill building, and student presentations. See the section on lab meetings for more details. Please communicate with the group if you are going to miss meetings. If you are missing research time and meetings often, Justin will reach out to discuss.&#x20;

6.) **Do you work!** We will all agree on expectations for ourselves and since we are a small lab, it is certain that your work will be done in collaboration with others. As such, not getting things done will effect more than just you. If you are struggling to keep up or need to adjust your workload please get in touch. Work together! Remember that science is collaborative, not competitive!

7.) **Use your lab notebook!** Document the work you are doing. Keep organized notes of your work in the lab and your data analysis. How you do this is going to be up to you but Justin will provide you with a lab notebook if you wish to use one. Keeping good records is essential in this work as many students will work together and folks will graduate or leave the lab before projects are finished. Notes are essential for the writing papers!
