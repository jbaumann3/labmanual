# Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice statement

As a lab, we are committed to fostering a space that is inclusive for all. Specifically, we are committed to the following actions

1.) Self-education on issues of race, classism, sexism, colonialism, and discrimination within academic and resesarch cultre as well as in our society at large.&#x20;

2.) contributing to the education of peers and students on these issues

3.) Lifting up diverse voices that encompass all perspectives and lived experiences. We will do this through reading and discussing papers written by folks who identify with groups outside of the majority, engaging with non-western scientific principles, and discussing the 'hidden curriculum' in academia to help ensure future success of students and researchers who are not already privy to this knowledge.&#x20;

4.) Actively recruiting, funding, supporting, and retaining LGBTQIA+ students, students of color, students with disabilities, indigenous students, and students from other underrepresented background. We will do this through active peer and PI mentorship and through community building.

5.) Providing (and building) a safe and comfortable space for folks from all background to learn and develop the skills they need or want in order to seek professional and personal fulfillment in life.&#x20;

6.) To use our own privelege to support those who are less priveleged and to push for individual growth and systemic change within all levels of the society from personal to lab to college-wide and beyond.&#x20;
