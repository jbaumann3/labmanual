# Lab Communications

Our lab will communicate in multiple ways:&#x20;

1.) **Through MHC email**. Please make sure you check your email frequently (during weekday work hours) and feel free to email one another and Justin about lab things.&#x20;

2.) **Slack**. We have a lab Slack. It is called Baumann\_lab\_MHC. Justin can invite you when you join the lab. The slack has multiple channels. Please use the channels for their appropiate uses. #Random is available for memes, random questions, etc. #General is for questions or communications that involve everyone. We can create additional channels for projects as needed.&#x20;

3.) **In person**. We will have regular lab meeting and we will also all chat in person as we are working in shared spaces. You can also schedule meetings with Justin as needed.&#x20;
