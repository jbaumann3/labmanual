# PI Expectations

As Principal Investigator (PI) in the lab, Justin (Dr. Baumann) promises to:

1.) **Abide by all of the guidelines outlines above** in the [code of conduct](code-of-conduct-and-community-guidelines.md)

2.) **Support you (the students) at all times**. This includes scientifically, emotionally, and financially. Seriously. If you work in the lab you deserve to be compensated through course credit and/or pay. If getting paid is a need for you let's talk. There are mechanisms we can use to try to make that happen.  &#x20;

3.) **Give you feedback on your work** (lab work, written work, project ideas, conference prep, etc) in a timely fashion. We will discuss timelines for feedback and will meet as necessary to discuss.&#x20;

4.) **Be availalbe.** I will be available via email, slack, or in person regularly during work hours (roughly 9-5 on weekdays). I will also meet regularly with the entire lab (group meetings) and with individual students (one on one individual meetings). Lab meeting time and frequency will be agreed upon by the group. Each lab member will have at least 2 one on one meetings with Justin each semester.&#x20;

5.) **Support your career development.** I will introduce you to folks within my network. I will also help your learn transferable and useful scientific skills including data analysis, experimental design, and scientific communcation (presentation and writing skills). I am always happy to find time to talk with you about your future, career goals, etc. This is one of the most rewarding parts of my job. This also includes writing letters of recommendation. See below for details.&#x20;

6.) **Train you!** This lab is entirely built around student learning, training, and leadership. We want students to take the reigns and explore their interests and passions. We also want you to try new things and seek feedback on how to be better. I want this from myself as well and training and mentoring always helps me do that. I learn as much (if not more) from all of you than you ever will from me. &#x20;

7.) **Care.** Not just for your work progress but for your emotional and physical well being. These are always our top priorities.
