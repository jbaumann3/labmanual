# Lab Meetings

We aim to have regular lab meetings (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc). These meetings allow us all to engage with one another to build community, develop a deeper understanding of our work, ask questions, and collaborate!&#x20;

If you are a member of the lab, you are strongly encouraged to attend meetings. Details on lab meeting time and place will be agreed upon by the entire lab at the start of each term. Keep an eye on emails for more details!
