# Land Acknowledgement

We acknowledge that in South Hadley, Massachusetts we are on stolen, unseeded Indigenous land - the territory of the Pocumtuk and Nipmuc nations. We are grateful for the opportunity to live and work and raise our families on this sacred land, and extend our respect to citizens of these Nations who live here today, and to their ancestors who have lived here for hundreds of generations, and to all Indigenous people. We recognize the repeated violations of sovereignty, territory, and water perpetrated by invaders who have impacted the original inhabitants of this land for 400 years. We know this acknowledgement is insufficient, and does not undo the harm that has been done and continues to be perpetrated now against Indigenous people, their land and water, especially here in Massachusetts.
