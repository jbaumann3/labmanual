# The Hidden Curriculum

Academia is problematic in many ways. As such, there are a plethora of equity issues within academic science, including the hidden curriculum. The hidden cuirriculum are all of the unspoken rules and expectations inherint in working in academic science. Tips and trick to manage such things are passed down informally. This process and the fact that such a 'curriculum' exists is elitist, exclusionary, unjust, and clear evidence of a white supremacist framework.&#x20;

To attampt to tear down generations of harm and exclusion, folks have started documenting the hidden curriculum. Shared here is a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P73tcyk5BopCgNmB2lKSog3vdAkw3drOGpUC2sJs-aA/edit?usp=sharing) curated by [Dr. Casey terHorst ](https://twitter.com/EcoEvoLab?s=20\&t=bS2IuRRe2MIoA6\_PRyWPHw)at Cal State Northridge
