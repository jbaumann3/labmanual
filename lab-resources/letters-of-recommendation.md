# Letters of Recommendation

Justin is happy to write letters of recommendation for student researchers. In fact, it is an essential part of his job (supporting you, helping with career development).&#x20;

Letters of recommendation are often needed as part of an application for internships, REU programs, graduate school, professional school, or jobs. Justin is happy to write these for you. To help him write the best letters possible he asks for the following:&#x20;

1.) **At least 2 weeks lead time**! If you ask me with at least 2 weeks lead time I will say yes! If you don't, I may not have time to write you a good letter. I WANT to write these for you but if you don't plan ahead it may not be possible.&#x20;

2.) **The position description**. I can write the best possible letter if I can see what they position is and what they want from a letter writer!

3.) **Any specific rules for my letter** (submit deadlines, forms, certain prompts or questions to answer, etc).&#x20;

4.) **An up to date CV or resume** (depending on the job posting). I prefer a CV as it contains much more information.&#x20;

5.) If you have **other materials** (cover letter, statements) those are also helpful to share,&#x20;

6.) **\*If you are applying to a lot of things (more than 3 letters at a time)\*: Please make me a spreadsheet!** Include a link to each position, due date(s), details, etc. This will allow me to stay on top of your needs and get your letters in on time.&#x20;

7.) I may ask you to meet with me to talk about career goals and plans and strategize what programs may be the best fit for you. If you want to talk about this kind of thing I am happy to do so at any point!

8.) If you are BRAND NEW to the lab I may not know you well enough to write you a letter.&#x20;
