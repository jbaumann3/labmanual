# Letters of Recommendation

Justin is happy to write letters of recommendation for student researchers. In fact, it is an essential part of his job (supporting you, helping with career development).&#x20;

Letters of recommendation are often needed as part of an application for internships, REU programs, graduate school, professional school, or jobs. Justin is happy to write these for you.

**Please please please try to give at least 2 weeks lead time**! If you ask me with at least 2 weeks lead time I will say yes! If you don't, I may not have time to write you a good letter. I WANT to write these for you but if you don't plan ahead it may not be possible.&#x20;

If you would like Justin to write you a letter (or letters) please **complete** [**this**](https://forms.gle/vw3d41cDvdFbyC9S7) **form** for each position.&#x20;

The form will ask for the following things:&#x20;

1.) **The position description**. I can write the best possible letter if I can see what they position is and what they want from a letter writer!

2.) **Any specific rules for my letter** (submit deadlines, forms, certain prompts or questions to answer, etc).&#x20;

3.) **An up to date CV or resume** (depending on the job posting). I prefer a CV as it contains much more information.&#x20;

4.) If you have **other materials** (cover letter, statements) those are also helpful to share,&#x20;

5.) Due Dates! I do not want to miss your due date so please make this as clear as possible and do not hesitate to remind me!

6.) I may ask you to meet with me to talk about career goals and plans and strategize what programs may be the best fit for you. If you want to talk about this kind of thing I am happy to do so at any point!

7.) If you are BRAND NEW to the lab I may not know you well enough to write you a letter.&#x20;
